Interface
An interface in TypeScript is used to define the shape (or structure) of 
an object. It specifies the properties and their types that an object 
should have, but it doesn’t generate any JavaScript code
 — it's purely for type-checking during development.

Types
 In TypeScript, type aliases (type) are another way to describe the
  shape or structure of data — similar to interfaces — but with more flexibility.
